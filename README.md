# Plant Disease Classification using Computer Vision

## Description:

This repository implements Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for a computer vision task: classifying citrus leaf diseases. It differentiates between Black spot, Canker, Greening, and Healthy leaves. The project explores training a CNN from scratch and utilizing transfer learning with pre-trained models like EfficientNetB0 and VGG16.
- This project demonstrates the application of computer vision techniques, specifically deep learning with CNNs, to an agricultural problem.
- By analyzing image data of citrus leaves, the model can learn to identify visual patterns associated with different diseases.

## Getting Started:
### Prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- TensorFlow Datasets
